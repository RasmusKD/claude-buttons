// Shutdown-on-done: per-chat toggle that powers the PC off when the armed chat
// finishes responding. Portable version (no hardcoded user paths).
//
// Two modes:
//   toggle on [--this-turn] | off | status
//     Run by Claude via the Bash tool; identifies the chat via CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID.
//     Default arming skips the toggle turn itself, so the shutdown fires when the
//     NEXT response finishes. --this-turn arms for the current turn (use when the
//     work and the arm request arrive in the same message).
//   (no args)
//     Stop-hook mode: reads the hook JSON from stdin and, if this session is armed,
//     starts a 60s-grace shutdown (abort with `shutdown -a`).
//
// Set SHUTDOWN_ON_DONE_DRYRUN=1 to test the Stop path without touching the PC.
