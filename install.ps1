  Claude Buttons - installer
  Usage:
    powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1
    ... -Update       (refresh program files + skills, keep your buttons.json)
    ... -Uninstall    (remove everything this installer added)
    ... -InstallDir "C:\path"   (override install location)
    ... -Shutdown     (also install the optional shutdown feature without prompting)
    ... -OneClickArm  (with -Shutdown: arm from the panel in ONE click, no approval prompt.
                       Read the note on Grant-ShutdownAllowRules before using it.)
    ... -NoAutostart / -Autostart   (skip / force the startup shortcut without prompting)

  What it does (core):
    - Copies the panel to %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\ClaudeButtons (outside any cloud-synced folder)
    - Installs the /pin and /unpin skills into ~/.claude/skills
    - Merges ONE hook (UserPromptSubmit) into ~/.claude/settings.json (backed up first)
  Optional (only if you opt in):
    - The shutdown feature (requires Node.js): the shutdown-on-done engine - a
      /shutdown-on-done skill, a completion-judged Stop hook and a stateful power
      button in the panel. OFF by default and always asks first.
